Group Messenger 2
=======

This project builds on the Group Messenger 1. Group Messenger 2 is an Android app that can multicast messages to multiple AVDs (devices), store the messages in a permanent key-value storage, and guarantee Total and FIFO ordering of the messages. It also detects and handles node (app instance) failures.

Messages are sent using a simple B-Multicast operation and stored in a SQLite database. For Total and FIFO ordering guarantees, the decentralized ISIS algorithm is implemented.
